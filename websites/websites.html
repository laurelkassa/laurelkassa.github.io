    <h1>Two Good Websites & One Bad Website</h1>

        <li><a href="https://www.freepeople.com">Good Website: Free People</a></li>
        <p> I enjoy this website for a lot of reasons. I am on it all the time which makes my experience and feelings towards Free People a good one. The colors in this website are very aesthetic. They are all soft colors, which is good for the season, transitioning from winter to spring. They have a lot of peach colored things which is pretty to look at. There is a lot of information on this website, talking about deals, new items, new catalogs, customer favorites etc. but I do not think it is overwhelming. There are more photos than words which makes my eyes appeciate the website more- I do not like to read too much. The code looks very confusing to me but in the scheme of things I think it looks decently clean. There are a ton of words, it looks like gibberish to me. But the indents and spaces make it easier to look at before my eyes go crossed. In this website they did a nice job of using their white spaces, but they look more of a pink color than pure white which is less harsh in my opinion. Also their "Free People" logo is in a beautiful cursive which makes me want to purchase their items even more.

        <li><a href="https://www.alaskaair.com">Good Website: Alaska Airlines</a></li>
        <p>There is not a whole lot going on throughout the Alaska Airlines website but honestly that is the way it should be, there should not be extra information on an airlines website in my opinion. The colors they use are nice for what their website is, it fits well. They are blues and greens which are some of the colors I would think of when I am thinking of going on vacation, especially to warmer weather. The navy they use is not too dark though, I normally do not like that color but I think this color is a bit warmer version of navy. The font they use is inviting which makes me a lot more willing to use it. They also have informative things when you scroll down, such as deals, credit cards, etc. but the photos they use are nice and fit well. This websites codes look very organized. I think they did not put too much on each line which then would make it look confusing to people who don't really know how to look at codes (me). I can navigate this pretty well actually. Something that this website does that sticks them apart from others is they use the same cholor scheme throughout which makes it pleasing to me. Even the photos they use when you scroll down match their logos colors. </p>

        <li><a href="https://spokane.craigslist.org">Bad Website: Craigslist (Spokane/Coeur d'Alene)</a></li>
        <p> I hate Craigslists website because the home page is so many words that you have no clue what to look at. It makes you forget what you came to the website for. I guess the people who are getting on Craigslist do not need to have the website super nice looking because if they're getting on they most likely aren't just "window shopping" they typically know what they are wanting. They tried to organize everything in catagories but I do not think they did it the right way. The catagories should have been on the side in my opinion, and they should have put photos on the main page to make it more inviting. Their code is actually nice looking- it looks like something we would have made in class. It has nice indents that makes it easy to look at. It really is not too confusing at all, surprisingly. They use two colors... white and blue. It does not look good. They should have put more time into that aspect. This website sets apart from others because they threw everything on one page rather than making it less confusing and doing tabs or something like that. There is not much that is nice in this website. It is nice that you can shop for things that you are needing, but that is about it. </p>
