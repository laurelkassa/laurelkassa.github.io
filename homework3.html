        <li><a href="https://www.vermont.gov">Vermont</a></li>
        <p>This is by far my favorite website. The search bar is front and center so it is easy to look around and maneuver. There is a good amount of pull tabs so I can choose what I want to look for. There is a nice amount of photos and they are pretty and it makes it look like Vermont is a place you would want to visit. The website loaded quickly and was ready for me to use. The screen looks nice on a computer, probably the best of all of the websites.

        <li><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></li>
        <p>This website was the fastest of all of them to load for me. It quickly had everything up and that was pleasing. There is a lot going on in this website, but it is easy to maneuver. I am able to find what I am looking for, but there is a lot of extra words on this webpage. I think it looks pretty nice but they could have had different pages with words, rather than all on the front page. This website looked nice on a computer, it fit well on the screen. The first photo on Alaska's website is very pretty- I think that gives Alaska a nice aesthetic look. </p>

        <li><a href="https://www.ok.gov">Oklahoma</a></li>
        <p>I like the top of this website, it looks aesthetic to me. This seems like an old website to me, like they have not updated it in a long time. They need to add a lot. I can find what I am looking for on the search bar, but there is no pull down tabs so I just have to search what I am looking for which I do not mind. The website looks nice on a computer, but there is some awkward space on the sides so they could change that to make it look better. </p>

        <li><a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a></li>
        <p>This website was quick to load, not the fastest, it was just pretty average. I think the colors are not as pleasing to me, it seems kind of dark to me. But I do like how they have the switching photos on the front page. I enjoy how there is not a ton of words right as you get on the front page, but there is later when you scroll. The website also looks nice on a computer, it fills the entire screen. I think the photos they used could have been much better because Tennessee is a pretty place but the photos they used didn't do it justice. </p>

        <li><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a></li>
        <p>At first glance this website is very boring. They do not have very many colors or photos. It is easy to maneuver and find what you are looking for but a website needs to have more than that. Because it doesn't have a lot going on it could be easy follow but it is my least favorite website for that reason. Luckily this website looked nice on a computer but since the computer screen is so big it is really empty. They need to add a lot to this website. </p>
